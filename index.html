	<h1>pytest mini-workshop</h1>
	<p>Welcome to the mini-workshop on pytest as part of CW18.</p>
	<!--<h2>Setup</h2>-->
	<p>
		You have two options for how to set run the examples as part of this workshop.
		You can either run the code locally on your laptop or connect to the web-based terminal.
	</p>
	<h2>On your laptop</h2>
	<p>
		To run the workshop on your laptop you'll need:
		<ul>
			<li>Python â‰¥ 3.3</li>
			<li>Git</li>
			<li>The ability to run a command-line</li>
			<li>A text editor</li>
		</ul>
		This is likely easy if you are running Linux or MacOS.
	</p>
	<p>
		Open a terminal and run the following:
		<div class="terminal">
			git clone https://github.com/milliams/pytest_miniworkshop.git<br/>
			cd pytest_miniworkshop<br/>
			python3 -m venv venv<br/>
			source venv/bin/activate<br/>
			pip install -r requirements.txt
		</div>
		at which point you are ready to start running <span class="terminal">pytest</span>. Try it!
	</p>
	<p></p>
	<h2>Web-based terminal</h2>
	<p>If you don't have easy access to a command-line or a Python installation on your laptop then try connecting to the web-based terminal service.</p>
	<p>
		Point your browser to <a href="http://pytestworkshop1.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/">pytestworkshop1.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com</a>.
		To find out what username and password you need, go to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dHUvMy7WHTsyLgM53g8_IX91OotL0AZ74T0Evhmjz8A/edit?usp=sharing">Google spreadsheet</a>, choose an unclaimed username and put your name next to it.
		I'll give the passwords out in-person.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you are logged in, do the following to make sure you are in a working environment:
		<div class="terminal">
			cd pytest_miniworkshop</br>
			source venv/bin/activate</br>
			pytest
		</div>
		You are then ready to go!
	</p>
